The objective of this project is to analyze the landscape of Shopify apps using data scraped from publicly available Shopify websites. The analysis focuses on identifying key factors that influence the success of apps in the Shopify marketplace. This involves creating a Power BI report with visualizations for key statistics, reviews, app performance, and developer responsiveness, using the shopify.xlsx dataset. The report will include KPIs, line charts, scatterplots, and bar charts to summarize insights into app trends, user reviews, and the effectiveness of developer engagement.
